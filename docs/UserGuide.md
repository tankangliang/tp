## Quickstart

<p>Before you start using <strong><i>TBM</i></strong>, </p>

1. Ensure you have Java 11.

1. Download the application file (.jar file) from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases).

1. Double click on the `tbm.jar` file found in the directory it was downloaded to.

1. Alternatively, from the directory containing `tbm.jar`, shift right click and open any shell terminal in the current directory.

1. Run `java -jar tbm.jar`.

Now that you have started TBM, 

1. Type any command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.

1. (Recommended) The [`help`](#Viewing-help-help) command will show a help page of some commonly used commands to fully utilise TBM, especially if you are a new user of TBM,

   * Type the **`help`** command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in round brackets mean that you have to supply at least one of them.<br>
  e.g. `INDEX (n/NAME) (n/PHONE_NUMBER)` can be used as `1 n/John Doe` or `1 p/98899889` or `1 n/John Doe p/98899889`, but not as `1` (i.e. both items are not supplied).

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
