## Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

:bulb: Running test using method 3 is more reliable, and it does not choke up your computer graphical interface.

* **Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner** (Not recommended)
  * To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
  * To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package,
    test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`
* **Method 2: Using Gradle**
  * Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)
* **Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)**
  * Open a console and run command `gradlew clean headless test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless test`)

## Types of tests

This project has three types of tests:

1. ##### GUI Tests
    These are tests which simulates user interaction with the application.

    a. *Unit tests* that test the individual GUI components. These are in the `seedu.address.ui` package.

1. ##### Non-GUI Tests
    These are tests not involving the GUI of TBM. They include,<br>
    a. *Unit tests* targeting the lowest level methods/classes.<br>

      e.g  `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`

    b. *Integration tests* that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>

      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`

    c. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>

      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
